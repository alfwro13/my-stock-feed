# RSS Feed Host

This repository serves as a static endpoint for an automated RSS feed system.

### Overview
This project is a utility to bridge Yahoo Finance news updates with standard RSS readers. A backend script fetches public financial news data, formats it into XML, and pushes it to this repository to be served via GitHub Pages.

### Feed Endpoints
* **Portfolio Feed:** `https://alfwro13.github.io/my-stock-feed/stocks_news_rss.xml`
* **Watchlist Feed:** `https://alfwro13.github.io/my-stock-feed/watchlist_news_rss.xml`

### Note to Visitors
There is no open-source library, application code, or content of interest for the general public in this repository. It functions strictly as a file host for private automation.
