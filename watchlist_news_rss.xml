The M&amp;amp;A environment is incredibly strong right now. A lot of the sales and trading groups have had a gangbuster year in 2025. We think that trend also continues. &amp;amp;nbsp;And particularly for Morgan Stanley, a very large percentage of their revenue also comes from the wealth management division. And that also is experiencing not only efficiency gains via automation and technology. But the mere fact that equity markets are at all-time highs, assets under management are growing, and that's a boon to the baseline or the bottom line rather as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richly valued tech and growth stocks have lost some momentum recently as investors kicked off the year by chasing bargains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both mid-caps and the small-cap Russell 2000 have been outperforming the S&amp;amp;P 500 so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other stocks on the move include BlackRock, which increased six percent.
