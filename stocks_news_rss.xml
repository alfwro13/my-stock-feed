In fact, equities worldwide — once the US is excluded — have risen around 30% since he took office a year ago, roughly double the S&amp;amp;P 500’s gain, according to MSCI’s index.  Trump’s comparison with his predecessors is no better: As far as the S&amp;amp;P 500 goes, the first-year gain under Trump clocks in as only the ninth best start to a term since World War II, according to CFRA.</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-stocks-trounce-p-500-131530108.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:15:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[AAPL] Apple (AAPL) Continued to Rebound in Q4</title><link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-continued-rebound-q4-130929219.html</link><description>Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC, an investment management company, released its “Mar Vista U.S. Quality Premier Strategy” fourth-quarter 2025 investor letter.
